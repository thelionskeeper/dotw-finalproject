# dotw-finalproject
For my final project I would like to create a portfolio of my sketchbook and translate it into an interactive web environment. I hope to have individual pages of my sketchbook floating in a 3D space, like feathers, which can then be clicked on to view fully. The thematic concept of my project is the motion of floating or suspension. In addition to this page, I would like to have one page that is composed of multiple layers of semi-transparent cloud images coupled with CSS transitions so that is appears like the viewer is situated within the clouds and in a state of suspension. And lastly, the third page will have a space theme composed of various particles suspended and slowly moving through a dark space. 
Besides the sketchbook page, I want interactivity to be limited. For the space page, I would like the user to be able to look around the space through the use of orbit controls but for the cloud-themed page I donâ€™t want there to be any sort of interactivity.
